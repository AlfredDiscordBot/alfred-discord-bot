# Your data is yours

You do not have to worry about anything, you can choose to not give us any data, it is possible to stay incognito using alfred \
We have snipe and AI feature, and **none of these actually stores your information permanently**. We store your guild ids for music and certain configuration like advanced security, i.e. if you enable it, by default, it comes as a clean slate. The music queue remains as it is. There's playlist for individuals, so we'll need user ID for that, or you can just not use the playlist feature

Now, you can have a look at the data we save, just by coming to our [Support server](https://discord.gg/XESZGvjDaT).

If you're an owner of Alfred's mutual server, you need to prove that and we'll show you details about the server only, if you came in as a user, I can show you all the variables that you are in. We may need time to process that data \
**WE ONLY ANSWER TO THE SERVER OWNER AND NOT THE MODS OF THE SERVER ABOUT GUILD/SERVER INFORMATION**

It's **YOUR** choice to remove your details from certain variable, have fun and have a nice day

We have message intent enabled as there's an AI which will respond to you, you can opt out of it using `'response`, it's a toggle switch, and when you edit a message to a command, this will auto respond to it. And unfortunately, on_reaction_add requires the message intent, which is a great part in alfred

Guild members intent is enabled for features like tickets, welcome messages and to know if the user is in a voice channel

## Here's a list of everything we collect
> Channel IDs for updates like security alert \
> Guild(another name for server) IDs for Music queue \
> User IDs for playlist

All of these are optional, Alfred is a moderation, music and memes bot, and we get your concern
