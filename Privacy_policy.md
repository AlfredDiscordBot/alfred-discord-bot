# Your data is yours

## Message from the Developer

You do not have to worry about anything, you can choose to not give us any data, it is possible to stay incognito using alfred \
We have snipe and AI feature, and **none of these actually stores your information permanently**. We store your guild ids for music and certain configuration like advanced security, i.e. if you enable it, by default, it comes as a clean slate. The music queue remains as it is. There's playlist for individuals, so we'll need user ID for that, or you can just not use the playlist feature

## Support server
Now, you can have a look at the data we save, just by coming to our [Support server](https://discord.gg/XESZGvjDaT).

## Cleaning you data
If you're an owner of Alfred's mutual server, you need to prove that and we'll show you details about the server only, if you came in as a user, I can show you all the variables that you are in. We may need time to process that data 


**WE ONLY ANSWER TO THE SERVER OWNER AND NOT THE MODS OF THE SERVER ABOUT GUILD/SERVER INFORMATION**

It's **YOUR** choice to remove your details from certain variable, have fun and have a nice day

## Intents and Information regarding intents

We have message intent enabled as there's an AI which will respond to you, you can opt out of it using `'response`, it's a toggle switch, and when you edit a message to a command, this will auto respond to it. And unfortunately, on_reaction_add requires the message intent, which is a great part in alfred

```
Guild members intent is enabled for features like tickets, welcome messages and to know if the user is in a voice channel. *It's for you to not get rickrolled*
```


## Here's a list of everything we collect
- Channel IDs for updates like security alert 
- Guild (another name for server) IDs for Music queue 
- User IDs for playlist
- Channel and Server IDs for configuration
- Server IDs for prefix `[Optional]`

If you see above, most of these are Server, User and Channel IDs, we do not store anything specific like list of channels, messages, etc.

```
    All of these are optional, Alfred is a moderation, music and memes bot, and we get your concern about your privacy, but it's as easy as joining our support server and opening a ticket
```

## Security of our Github Branch/Repository
